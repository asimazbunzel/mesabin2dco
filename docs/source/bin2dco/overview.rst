Overview of bin2dco module
==========================

The MESA bin2dco module (actually a wrapper) launches binary evolutions while also cheking for
important stages such as a Common Envelope (CE) phase and the core collapse of a massive star.

The origin of this wrapper comes from the fact that these two stages are not part of the MESA core
modules and we (Binary-rEvolution collaboration) were exploring scenarios in which these two phases
are very important (see `our presentation paper <https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/05/aa38357-20/aa38357-20.html>`__).

Controls for the wrapper are found under :ref:`Options of mesabin2dco <defaults>`
