Documentation of modules developed for the *mesabin2dco* wrapper.

The wrapper itself is also explain as if it was a module, even though formally it's not a MESA
module. On the other hand, both ``ce`` and ``core_collapse`` are proper MESA modules as they follow
the general structure described by the MESA developers in
`Module documentation <https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r15140/modules.html>`__

Bin2dco (``bin2dco``)
